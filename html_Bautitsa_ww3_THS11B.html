<h2> What is the Kratky Method?</h2>
	<p>This is a method of hydroponics that takes the least maintenance and cost. It's a passive hydroponics method 
	where plants grow in a nutrient-rich water solution without pumps, electricity, or constant monitoring and care. It is a great way for beginners
	to start a hydroponics unit at home without being too costly and time consuming.</p>

<h2> <b>I. SEEDLING STAGE</b> </h2>
	<ol>
		<li> Start by filling your <b>Seedling Tray</b> to the top with <b>Coco Pith</b> that you made damp with some water. Don't make the coco pith too wet. Do <u><b>NOT</b></u> pack it too tight; just make sure there are no gaps in the soil.
		<li> Put <b>exactly TWO</b> seeds into each cell in the tray. Drop them in the middle of each cell, push them down about <b> 2 cm</b> down into the soil, and cover them with the excess.
		<li> Fill the <b>Flat Tray with No Holes</b> with water and place the lettuce tray on top of the flat tray.</li>
		<b><u>- The nursery time period usually lasts 14 days.</b></u>
		<li><b>For the first 7 days</b>, soak once every morning, making sure you give the tray enough water.
		<li><b>For the following 7 days</b>, soak the tray every morning and afternoon. Fill the flat tray with water every morning, and top it off in the afternoon.</li>
		<b>- <u> Additionally, if you notice the water doesn't get soaked up by the end of the day/soaking period, reduce the amount of water you use.</u></b>
	</ol>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2> <b>II. Preparing the Water</b> </h2>
	<ol>
		<li> Measure the volume of the water in liters equivalent to filling the <b>Plant Box</b> nearly full.
		<li> Prepare the amount of your <b>Nutrient Solution Liquids</b> equivalent to the volume of water. For example: If you need 1.5 ml of nutrient solution for 1 L of water, and your box holds 60 L of water, then you should put 90 ml of each solution into the water.
		<li> Test the water for its pH and PPM levels. For lettuce: <b>PPM</b> should ideally be <b>560-840</b>; <b>pH</b> should ideally be <b>5.5-6.5</b>
		<li> Carefully adjust the pH level with your <b>pH Down/Up Liquids</b> according to the products' instructions.
	</ol>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2> <b>III. TRANSPLANTING</b> </h2>
	<p> After 2 weeks, each cell should have at least 1-2 lettuce sprouts. Each sprout should have ideally 4 leaves each.</p>
	<ol>
		<li> Prepare your <b>Hydro Cups</b>. Fill them around halfway up with new damp <b>Coco Pith</b>.
		<li> Seperate the sprouts of each cell and place one lettuce sprout into a cup and use the old soil to stabilize the sprout upright. Make sure you dont break the roots and untangle them carefully.
		<li> Finally, place your cups into the holes of each box.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>- Lettuce should generally take around 3-6 weeks to grow fully before harvesting.<br>
	- The water of your plant box should be refilled/topped off every week or two.<br>
	- If you want to keep the cycle going, you should germinate some new seeds in your trays about a week before harvesting.</h3>
